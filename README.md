This repository represents part of a larger project funded by
Proposition 1 Delta Water Quality and Ecosystem Restoration Program and
administered by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, titled:
*“Trade-offs and Co-benefits of Landscape Change Scenarios on Bird
Communities and Ecosystem Services in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River
Delta”*, also known as Phase 1 of the [Delta Multiple
Benefits](https://pointblue.github.io/DeltaMultipleBenefits/) project.

Task 4 of this larger project entailed developing and analyzing the
impacts of alternative landscapes representing the potential magnitude
and spatial distribution of land cover change in the Delta resulting
from two major drivers of landscape change: (1) restoration of riparian
and nontidal wetland habitat to meet objectives in the Delta plan, and
(2) continued expansion of perennial crops. A third alternative combined
both of these drivers of landscape change. We developed each of these
alternative landscapes and estimated the net change that would result
from a recent baseline landscape for multiple metrics representing
several categories ecosystem benefits of interest in the Delta:
agricultural livelihoods, water quality, climate change resilience, and
biodiversity support.

This repository documents the development of each of these alternative
landscapes, metrics, and analysis of the net changes from baseline. It
was developed in parallel with the `DeltaMultipleBenefits` R package,
which contains the functions necessary to running these analyses. This
repository contains only the primary scripts and outputs not otherwise
available in the R package or other data archives and repositories
(linked below). Additional related data are stored on Point Blue’s
server
(Z:/Terrestrial/programs_and_projects/delta_multiple_benefits/delta-scenarios),
including: source data available elsewhere too large to store on Github,
other earlier and intermediate versions of scripts and outputs, output
figures, and related GIS data.
