### About

This project is part of Point Blue Conservation Science's grant "Trade-offs and Co-benefits of Landscape Change Scenarios on Bird Communities and Ecosystem Services in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta", funded by Delta Water Quality and Ecosystem Restoration Program Grant Agreement Number â€“ Q1996022, administered by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 

**Current Project Team:** Kristen Dybala (PI), Catherine Hickey, Matt Reiter, Kristin Sesser

### Project overview

Achieving the long-term vision of a resilient Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta ecosystem requires meeting multiple goals simultaneously in a landscape that continues to evolve. To help meet this challenge, Point Blue Conservation Science is leading research to examine the effects of future landscape change in the Delta on bird populations and on the ecosystem services that benefit people in the Delta. Our goal is to develop a transparent and flexible framework for evaluating co-benefits and trade-offs among multiple goals under different scenarios of future landscape change.


### Objectives & Current status

The specific objectives of this Project are to: 

* Synthesize scientific information on indicators of ecosystem services associated with land cover types that occur in the Delta. [[View science synthesis report](http://www.prbo.org/refs/files/12650_PetersonCA2020.pdf)]

* Model the distributions of waterbirds and riparian landbirds in the Delta, and identify high priority bird conservation areas in the Delta. [[View summary report](http://www.prbo.org/refs/files/12713_DybalaKE2021.pdf)]

* Evaluate the net impact of scenarios of landscape change on bird populations and 
ecosystem services [[View scenarios](scenarios.html)]

* Develop a flexible, science-based framework for assessing the trade-offs and co-benefits 
of landscape changes [*In progress*]

* Engage with partners to demonstrate the need to consider trade-offs and co-benefits in making land use decisions and provide training in how to use our science-based framework.

* Disseminate results to the broader scientific community through scientific manuscripts and conference presentations.


### How to engage

We anticipate reaching out to partners at several stages of the project, both to gather input as the project is developing, and to share results. If you have questions or would like to be on our list, please contact: [Dr. Kristen Dybala](mailto:kdybala@pointblue.org), Principal Ecologist, Point Blue Conservation Science.
