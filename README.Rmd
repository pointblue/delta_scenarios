# Trade-offs and Co-benefits of Landscape Change Scenarios in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta

This repository represents part of a larger project funded by Proposition 1 Delta Water Quality and Ecosystem Restoration Program and administered by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, titled: *"Trade-offs and Co-benefits of Landscape Change Scenarios on Bird Communities and Ecosystem Services in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta"*, also known as Phase 1 of the [Delta Multiple Benefits](https://pointblue.github.io/DeltaMultipleBenefits/) project. 

Task 4 of this larger project entailed developing and analyzing the impacts of alternative landscapes representing the potential magnitude and spatial distribution of land cover change in the Delta resulting from two major drivers of landscape change: (1) restoration of riparian and nontidal wetland habitat to meet objectives in the Delta plan, and (2) continued expansion of perennial crops. A third alternative combined both of these drivers of landscape change. We developed each of these alternative landscapes and estimated the net change that would result from a recent baseline landscape for multiple metrics representing several categories ecosystem benefits of interest in the Delta: agricultural livelihoods, water quality, climate change resilience, and biodiversity support.

This repository documents the development of each of these alternative landscapes, metrics, and analysis of the net changes from baseline. It was developed in parallel with the `DeltaMultipleBenefits` R package, which contains the functions necessary to running these analyses.
